# Match maker

The **match maker** is a *Lambda* function that creates rooms for users.

Users have to send their preference (coming from the **recommender system**), and the **match maker** try to satisfy as many users as possible.

We already have a *Lightsail* instance running in the cloud. For simplicity, we will not use *Lambda* for now. The **match maker** will communicate with the **fleet manager** through an open port, both on the same machine.

# Development

```sh
cd match-maker
docker build -t <your-image> .
docker run -dp <your-port>:8080 <your-image>
# Go to http://localhost:<your-port>/docs to test your API
```
