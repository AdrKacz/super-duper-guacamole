### Android

## How to release

**CodeMagic** will release a new version of the app in the *App Store - Testflight* and the *Google Play Store - Internal* when a new version of `chat-application` is push to the `main` branch.

**CodeMagic** uses a *iOSDistribution* certificate and profile stored locally (ask @AdrKacz) and copied to *CloudMagic Cloud*.

## How to *manually* release

> You shoudn't have to release manually. Release is handled by **CodeMagic**

1. **Increment the build number `x.y.z+a` in `pubspec.yaml`**

2. Run `flutter clean` before building to avoid past artefacts.

### iOS

> [Flutter documentation - iOS deployment](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios)

> **Update `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project/pbxproj` to use build information from `pubspec.yaml` (see [StackOverflow - Update Version and Build number](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61922857/how-to-force-flutter-to-update-my-version-and-build-number/67080868#67080868))**

```
flutter build ipa
```

Then open `.xcarchive` on `Finder` and click on `Validate`.
