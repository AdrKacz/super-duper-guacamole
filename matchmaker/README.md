# Matchmaker

The **matchmaker** is a *Lambda* function that creates rooms for users.

Users have to send their preference (coming from the **recommender system**), and the **matchmaker** try to satisfy as many users as possible.

We already have a *Lightsail* instance running in the cloud. For simplicity, we will not use *Lambda* for now. The **matchmaker** will communicate with the **fleet manager** through an open port, both on the same machine.

# Environment

Variable | Expected value
-- | --
**MAXIMUM_ROOM_SIZE** | Maximum number of users in a room
**IP_ADDRESS** | Public host IP address
**HOST_ADDRESS** | Host address of the docker container

# Development

```sh
cd matchmaker
docker build -t <your-image> .
docker run -dp 8080:8080 -e MAXIMUM_ROOM_SIZE=$MAXIMUM_ROOM_SIZE -e IP_ADDRESS=$IP_ADDRESS -e HOST_ADDRESS=$HOST_ADDRESS <your-image> 
# Go to http://localhost:<your-port>/docs to test your API
```
