# Recommender system

## Introduction
We want to:
- assign people to conversation groups (the challenge is to match them with people they will like while not matching them always with the same people),
- preserve the privacy of the users.

We implement a federated algorithm[^model0] to reach our goals. The algorithm works with data without aggregating them on a server.

# Local information available
Locally each user has access to, at a given time:
- its ID,
- IDs of the users of its current conversations,
- messages of its current conversations.

## To get a recommendation list
```mermaid

      actor User as User
      participant MM as Master Model
      participant OUM as Online User Model
      participant m as Mapping
      User ->> MM: GET recommendation for user u (HTTP API Gateway)
      Note right of User: API Gateway HTTP - userid in the path
      MM ->> m: GET mapping
      alt NO existing mapping
      m ->> MM: Return Error (No existing mapping)
      Note right of MM: TODO: create a map for this user to avoid the HTTP "user not found" error
      end

      alt Existing Mapping
      m ->> MM: Return mapped userid
      MM ->> MM: Process & Check HTTP request
      MM ->> OUM: GET User gradient of Master Model and Recommendation
      Note right of MM: Call between lambdas on AWS
      OUM ->> OUM: Process and update User Model
      OUM ->> MM: Recommendation and gradient transmission
      MM ->> User: Recommendation transmission
      MM ->> MM: Master Model update
      end
```

## To update the rating matrix
```mermaid

      actor User as User
      participant R as Ratings
      participant m as Mapping
      User ->> User: Has participated in a conversation
      User ->> R: GET update Ratings for userid
      Note right of User: API Gateway HTTP
      R ->> m: GET Mapping (Supposed to exist because required to enter a conversation)
      alt NO existing mapping
      m ->> R: RETURN Error (No existing mapping)
      Note right of R: Error could happen if *user id* changes during a conversation
      R ->> User: Response : StatusCode: 400
      end

      alt Existing mapping
      m ->> R: RETURN mapped user_id
      R ->> R: PROCESS & CHECK HTTP request
      R ->> R: UPDATE row user_id of R matrix
      R ->> User: Response : StatusCode: 200
      end
```

      User ->> User: Recommendation, gradient computation, update User Model
      User ->> Model: POST gradient Master Model matrix
      Model ->> User: Response : StatusCode: 200
      Model ->> Model: Master Model update
```



# AWS Setup:
We use Python with NumPy in an AWS Lambda function. NumPy is not available in the Python AWS default environment. The only solution proposed in the AWS documentation that we succeeded to implement was to create a dockerized environment.

## Container setup with Docker for Python[^cont0][^cont1]
1. Create a project directory for your new function on your computer (here *recommender-system*).
2. Open your project directory and add a file named `app.py`.
3. Add your code to `app.py` (you need a handler function).
```
# app.py - hello world example
import numpy

def handler(event, context):
    return np.zeros((10,10))
```
4. In your project directory, add a file named `requirements.txt`. List each required library as a separate line in this file.
5. Create a Dockerfile:  
(Install dependencies under the `${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}` directory alongside the function handler to ensure that the Lambda runtime can locate them when you invoke your function.)
```
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.9

# Copy function code
COPY app.py ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}

# Install the function's dependencies using file requirements.txt
# from your project folder.

COPY requirements.txt  .
RUN  pip3 install -r requirements.txt --target "${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}"

# Set the CMD to your handler (could also be done as a parameter override outside of the Dockerfile)
CMD [ "app.handler" ]
```

5. Create an Amazon ECR repository using the AWS Console (*it is easier*). Copy the corresponding URI.

6. Authenticate the Docker CLI to your Amazon ECR registry.  
```
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-3 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123456789012.dkr.ecr.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com
```

7. Build your Docker image with:
```
docker build -t 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hello-world:latest
```
8. Push it in the ECR with 
```
docker push 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hello-world:latest
```

> **You need to enter the folder where you put your Dockerfile to build**

## Create a Database with DynamoDB

1. Create a table:
    - Primary Key partitioning **type**: `chain`
    - Primary Key partitioning **name**: `user_id`
2. *[Optional]* Create elements within the table
3. Copy your ARN to connect to your Lambda function[^cloud0]


## Setup a Lambda
### Create a Lambda

1. Container image (Use URI of the container)
2. Create an HTTP API Gateway.
3. Manage the IAM (Configuration--> Authorization) to allow the Lambda to access different services (*example: DynamoDB[^cloud0] GET and PUT methods*)

### To configure the HTTP API
You only need the standard configuration for your API Gateway HTTP.

Call : `api_endpoint?userid=Ã§amarche&maman=kklm`  
(ex: `.../hello-world?user_id=2&tomato=abcd&potato=1234`)  

To get the input parameters:
``` 
from urllib import parse
def handler(event, context):
    url_parsed = parse.parse_qs(event["rawQueryString"])
    # Return {'user_id': ['2'], 'tomato':['abcd'], 'potato': ['1234']}
```

### To use a Lambda from another Lambda[^cloud1]
1. Create the second Lambda
2. Manage the IAM of the first Lambda to access the second:  
In the AWS Console Interface of Lambda: --> Configuration --> Permissions --> Execution Role (click, IAM page will open). --> Add permissions --> Create Inline Policy :
    - Service: Lambda
    - Actions: InvokeFunction, InvokeAsync
    - Resource: ARN of the targeted Lambda
3. To test the connexion, put in the handler function:
```
import boto3
# Define the client to interact with AWS Lambda
client_lambda = boto3.client('lambda')
# Define the input parameters that will be passed on to the model x function
inputParams = {"user_id" : user_id,
                "tomato": tomato,
                "potato" : potato
                }

response = client_lambda.invoke(
    FunctionName = 'arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-3:000000000000:function:hello-world-2',
    InvocationType = 'RequestResponse',
    Payload = json.dumps(inputParams))
response_from_child = json.load(response['Payload'])
output = responseFromChild['output_2']
```

### Define environment variable
For instance, to not write Lambda ARNs in the code, you can define it as an environment variable:  
1. Define it with the AWS Console Interface: Lambda --> Configuration --> Environment variables
2. Get it in the code with:
```
import os
ARN_LAMBDA_X = os.environ.get('ARN_LAMBDA_X')
```
