# Steps for CI/CD (*do later, kind of bored on this*)

[Detox](https://wix.github.io/Detox/docs/introduction/getting-started)

```
brew tap wix/brew
brew install applesimutils

yarn add -D detox-cli
yarn add -D detox

yarn remove -D detox-cli
yarn remove -D detox
```

# How to build?

## Android

Go to `awa/android/app/build.gradle` and increase **Version code**.

```
cd awa/android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

If there are errors, open **Android Studio** and build from here to see what are the problems. Most of the time file are duplicated, which causes problem when instantiate classes.

Then go to Google Play Console, update a new build.

## Web

```
heroku login
git subtree push --prefix awa-web heroku master
```

## iOS

Increment build number at `awa/ios/awa.xcodeproj`

Go to `Action` and run `Fastlane iOS CD`
