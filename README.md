# Cloud Architecture

> We chose a **centralised architecture** to use state-of-the-art libraries in Machine Learning with **Python**. However, we keep the code as close as possible to a **decentralised** version, so we will be able to switch later on. The goal is to verify the model works.

## Current Architecture - Centralised

![awa-services](./diagram-cloud-architecture/awa_service.png)

> This architecture is *centralised*

In a **centralised architecture**, the code that infers the correct set of users belongs to the **cloud**. Thus, it uses whatever languages.

## Ideal Architecture - Distributed and Decentralised

> `Federated` architecture will simply remove the **_client models_ database**

In a **distributed architecture**, the code that infers the correct set of users belongs to the **user app**. Thus, it uses the client technologies.

# How an user find a room?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant r as recommender system
    actor u as user
    participant m as matchmaker
    participant f as fleet manager
    u ->> r: who are the best users for me?
    r ->> u: Set of users
    u ->> m: I want a room with these users
    m ->> m: find best existing room
    alt room is not good enough
      m -->> f : create new room
      f -->> m : room endpoint
      m -->> m : save room endpoint
    end
    m ->> u: room endpoint
    m ->> u : endpoint
```

# How room are managed?

## User - Start Awa

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant oth as other room users
    actor u as user
    participant m as matchmaker
    participant s as websocket server
    participant f as firebase
    u ->> u: GET room on disk
    alt has room
        u ->> s: connect to websocket server
        alt connection not accepted
            u ->> f: unsubscribe to room_id topic
            u ->> u: delete room
        end
    end
    alt room is not defined
        u ->> m: GET room
        m ->> m: process [user ask for a room]
        m ->> u: room_id, room_address, room_port
        u ->> f: subscribe to room_id topic
    end
    u ->> s: connect to websocket server
    loop while room alive
        oth ->> s: send message
        alt is app in foreground
            s ->> u: broadcast message
        else
            f ->> u: notify user
        end
    end
```

## Disk management

### On open

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant u as user
    participant d as disk
    participant m as matchmaker
    participant w as websocket server
    u -> d: CONNECT room BOX
    u -> d: CONNECT messages LAZYBOX
    alt room BOX has id
        u ->> d: GET messages LAZYBOX - end
        loop 0..end
            u ->> d: GET messages LAZYBOX - i
        end
    else
        u ->> m: GET room
        u ->> d: PUT room BOX - room
        
    end
    u -> w: CONNECT room
```

### On send message

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant u as user
    participant d as disk
    participant m as matchmaker
    participant w as websocket server
    u -> w: CONNECT room
    loop until deconnexion
        par
            u ->> w: SEND message
        and
            w ->> u: RECEIVE message
            u ->> u: update local messages
            u ->> d: ADD messages LAZYBOX - message
        end
    end
```

## User - Ask for a room

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor u as user
    participant m as matchmaker
    participant f as fleet manager
    u ->> m: GET room
    m ->> m: GET room for user in memory
    alt has no room
        m ->> f: GET new room
        f ->> f: create new room
        alt has room
            f ->> m: RETURN room
        else
            f ->> m: RETURN error
            m ->> u: RETURN error
        end
    end
    m ->> m: update room in memory
    m ->> u: RETURN room
```

### Matchmaker memory logic

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    direction TB
    state i1 <<choice>>
    [*] --> i1
    i1 --> n: has next room
    i1 --> c: no more room
    n: next room
    v: valid room

    state i2 <<choice>>
    n --> i2
    i2 --> v: room has space
    i2 --> n: room is full
    an: add user to room
    v --> an

    c: new room
    ac: add new room with user
    c --> ac

    an --> [*]
    ac --> [*]
```

## Fleet manager - Create new room

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant f as fleet manager
    participant dd as docker daemon
    participant w as websocket server
    f ->> dd: GET containers
    loop containers
        f ->> dd: GET container image
        alt is websocket server
            f ->> dd: GET container status
            alt is running
                f ->> dd: GET container open ports
                alt has open ports
                    f ->> f: update available ports
                end
            end
        end
    end

    f ->> f: GET available port
    alt is available port
        f ->> w: RUN container on available port
    end
```

### Note on Godot

Using **Godot** for a simple chat may *not be the best idea*. Indeed, **Godot** is really useful when it comes to *real-time 2D* and *real-time 3D*. Using a standard technology (*ReactNative*) would be more appropriate here.

### Note on Flutter

**Flutter** is quicker to setup than **React Native** *(I mean, literally quicker, it doesn't burn my laptop)*. I've used (Flutter Chat UI)[https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_chat_ui] to get a first chat without coding. *The same framework was available with **React Native***
